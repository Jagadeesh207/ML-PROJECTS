
Anti-overfitting strategies applied:
- RandomForest: tune max_depth, min_samples_leaf, cross-validation.
- ANN: dropout, L2, BatchNormalization, EarlyStopping (restore_best_weights).
- Preprocessing: StandardScaler for numeric features, OneHotEncoder for crop.
Suggestions to further reduce overfitting:
- Use k-fold CV or repeated CV, feature selection, ensembling, per-crop regressors when appropriate.
